## Data Model

```
I choose https://www.diagrams.net/ because:

1. It is a web based tool so I do not need to install any app on my machine. This is my fav reason
2. The web app does not require online login or registration
3. It is free and open source
4. It can be used to create several diagrams such as UML, datamodels, Cloud architectures diagrams and many more.
