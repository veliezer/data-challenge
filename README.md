# Data Engineer - Challenge
This is the Basic Challenge for Data Engineers. 

Lider.cl wants to create a new shiny section for videogames, to bring custom videogame information to our clients, our Analytics team needs a new report each day with several videogames information. This information will be used to create a lot of ML models & Data Science to give our customers the best experience and make the best decision of which videogame buy.

For this Challenge, we want you to do a Job who give us the Data for the Analytics team, but with a few concerns:
- The Job must be an ETL code in Java or Scala or Python.
- We need the Data Model for the problem.
- And we want a Deployment for this code.

## ETL Job
The job must receive the datasets & brings a few things:
- The top 10 best games for each console/company.
- The worst 10 games for each console/company.
- The top 10 best games for all consoles.
- The worst 10 games for all consoles.
The data is in the folder data/ in the root. The report can be exposed in any way you want, but remember this is an ETL Job.

## Data Model
The Data Model must be in 3NF. 
Save the model in the DataModel folder in both formats (data model format & JPG/PNG).
```
Use any tool, but please tell us the tool you choose & why.

## Concerns
- You can create a new README for anything you want to tell us. Please don't name README.md
- We want to see if you know how to code in a professional way, so use the best practices of Software Engineering!.
- This is an ETL Job, so show us all you know about good practices to do ETL's.
